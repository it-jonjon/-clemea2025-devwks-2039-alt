# Task 6: Cost Report  

Our organization's accounting department has requested a real-time usage report to identify the cost of Duo across all client accounts. They need details regarding the **edition count** and the number of **users per edition**. This report will help with financial analysis and cost allocation.  


## **1. Generate the Cost Report**  
**Navigate to the** **Duo Admin API [Child]** collection >> **Cost Report**
